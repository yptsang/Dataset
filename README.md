Eco-design Perception of Smart Glasses
This is the dataset used in the following research work:
In this dataset, 33 valid responses were collected and used for the comparative analysis, while C1 to C4 represents (i) multi-purpose and recyclable, (ii) long-lasting product lifetime, (iii) technological design for sustainability and (iv) green message dissemination.
In the first part, the intuitive weights for C1 to C4 are collected (the sum of the intuitive weights is equal to 1). In the second part, the best-worst pairwise compairson data (i.e. the pairwise comparison following the best worst method) are collected. The importance scales 1-5 denote: Equally Important (EI), Weakly Important (WI), Fairly Important (FI), Very Important (VI) and Absolutely Important (AI).
